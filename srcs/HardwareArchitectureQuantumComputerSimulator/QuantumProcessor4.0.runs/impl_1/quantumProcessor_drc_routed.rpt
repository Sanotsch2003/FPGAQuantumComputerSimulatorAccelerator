REQP-1840#7 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 programMemory_inst/memory_reg has an input control pin programMemory_inst/memory_reg/ADDRARDADDR[6] (net: programMemory_inst/ADDRARDADDR[2]) which is driven by a register (controlUnit_inst/program_counter_reg[2]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>
