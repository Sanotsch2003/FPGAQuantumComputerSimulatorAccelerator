Version 1.0

- can apply x, t, hadamard to target qubit and calculate state vector
- can send calculated state vector via uart to receiver

Version 2.0

- added functionality to apply gates as controlled gates (benutzt bei Regionalwettberb Jugend Forscht)


Version 3.0
- state Vector can be reset after sent via uart
- added Bootloader to program Processor
- Added Python software to write Program to Processor (Serial interface with terminal Commands to send individual bytes or entire Programs)

Version 3.1

- removed unnecessary clock cycles in some instructions
- design improvements (reset functions)
- added functionality to overclock processor (operates now at 200Mhz instead of 100Mhz)

Version 4.0

-added multithreading
-> Ram controller added, possibility to change number of cores dynamically
-> adjusted instruction set
